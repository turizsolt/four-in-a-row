# four-in-a-row

This is the classical four-in-a-row game played by two player.
Red starts, then the players move alternating.

cell from the bottom. (Like you drop from the top.)

The player wins when there is four pieces in a row horisontally, vertically
or diagonally. If there is no free cell left, that is a draw.
